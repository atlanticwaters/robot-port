### 4. Publish Documents

After creating each document, click **"Publish"** to make it live.

### 5. Verify on Your Site

Once published, refresh http://localhost:3000 and you should see your real content instead of mock data!

## Alternative: Use Slice Machine (If Custom Types Are in Code)

If you have custom type definitions in your codebase, you can push them to Prismic using Slice Machine:

```bash
cd apps/web
npx start-slicemachine
```

Then in the Slice Machine UI:

1. Click "Push to Prismic"
2. Select the custom types to push
3. Confirm

## Troubleshooting

### Site Still Shows Mock Data

- Check that documents are **published** (not just saved as draft)
- Verify the UID matches what the site expects
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Check the Next.js server logs for errors

### Custom Types Not Appearing

- Make sure you're logged into the correct Prismic account
- Verify you're in the **fairway** repository
- Custom types need to be created OR pushed from Slice Machine
